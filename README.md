# This Day in History

## About

This Day in History is an application that gives users the ability to select a day in history by the month/day and find out interesting trivia about that day. Users can also select a random day that will give them trivia about a random day in history.

This project was submitted as the final project of Module 4 of the back-end program at Turing School of Software and Design. The goal of the project was to mimic a take-home challenge that a person may receive during a job application process.

The trivia is pulled from the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com) date endpoint.

## Live Application

The live application can be found here: [This Day in History](https://tcraig7.github.io/this_day_in_history/)

**Please note that this a mobile-first application, and so should be viewed through the developer tools device toolbar**
